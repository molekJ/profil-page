          My previous professional experience is quite diverse. I have worked in
          many places and I have done different types of work. In each job I
          came to the point where I needed new challenges. The challenges were
          not showing up, so I was changing my profession. The time has come to
          redirect professional field, where I will be able to develop and I
          will receive new duties. I had basics of programming in college -
          that's why I knew the programming will fulfill my expectations.

          I have signed up to bootcamp Front-end in infoShare Academy, in which
          I learned strong basics to create my own projects. Currently I learn
          in my own, I use websites resources like:{" "}
